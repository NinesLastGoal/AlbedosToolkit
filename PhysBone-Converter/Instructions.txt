This tool will convert your PhysBones and PBColliders to DynamicBones and DBColliders.
Of course, it's not perfect but it does almost the inverse conversion of PhysBones.

How to use
----------
Find the tool's window near the top left corner of Unity under
DreadTools > Utility > PhysBone Converter

1- Make sure that your avatar or root is correctly set as "Root".
2- Press Convert. Done!

You can optionally disable the "Auto" option for any setting and set your own value and curve. 
This will be the same value across all DynamicBones
